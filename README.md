# Mock-Accounting-Site
Pages I created for a school project, a mock accounting site, such as log-in, sign-up, password reset, main dashboard, and accounting table page as well as all features in them.
This project is currently in progress for school, and can change at any given time. Certain features are hard coded due to reliance on files my partners created and have posession of.
